  %p BusGripes is an app that allows you to report and find out about bad bus driving.
  %p You can report an incident giving location, up to 4 different problems, take or upload a picture and add a comment. Also available are heatmaps showing where problems occur the most and in the near future you will be able to filter this over time as well.
  %p While most bus drivers are good a few are at best annoying and at worst down-right dangerous! BusGripes will allow you to record an incident you've and will be made available to bus companies and commissioning bodies like Transport For London and local councils.
  %p Please feel free to get in touch and let us know how we can improve this service or if you have any bright ideas!
